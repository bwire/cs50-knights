# Knights and Knaves Puzzle Solver

A Python implementation of a propositional logic solver for classic Knights and Knaves puzzles from CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python.

## üß© About Knights and Knaves Puzzles

Knights and Knaves puzzles are classic logic puzzles where:
- **Knights** always tell the truth
- **Knaves** always lie
- You must determine who is who based on their statements

This project implements a propositional logic engine that can solve these puzzles automatically using model checking.

## üöÄ Features

- **Propositional Logic Engine**: Complete implementation of logical operators (And, Or, Not, Implication, Biconditional)
- **Model Checking**: Automated puzzle solving using truth table enumeration
- **Four Classic Puzzles**: Pre-implemented solutions for classic Knights and Knaves scenarios
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new puzzles and logical statements

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cs50-knights
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment** (if not already done):

   ```

## üéØ Usage

### Running the Puzzles

Simply run the main script to see all puzzle solutions:

```bash
python puzzle.py
```

### Example Output

```
Puzzle 0
    A is a Knave

Puzzle 1
    A is a Knave
    B is a Knight

Puzzle 2
    A is a Knave
    B is a Knight

Puzzle 3
    A is a Knight
    B is a Knave
    C is a Knight
```

## üß† Puzzle Descriptions

### Puzzle 0: The Contradiction
- **A says**: "I am both a knight and a knave."
- **Solution**: A must be a knave (since no one can be both)

### Puzzle 1: The Mutual Accusation
- **A says**: "We are both knaves."
- **B says**: nothing
- **Solution**: A is a knave, B is a knight

### Puzzle 2: The Identity Crisis
- **A says**: "We are the same kind."
- **B says**: "We are of different kinds."
- **Solution**: A is a knave, B is a knight

### Puzzle 3: The Complex Chain
- **A says**: either "I am a knight." or "I am a knave." (unknown which)
- **B says**: "A said 'I am a knave'."
- **B says**: "C is a knave."
- **C says**: "A is a knight."
- **Solution**: A is a knight, B is a knave, C is a knight

## üîß Technical Details

### Logic Engine Components

The `logic.py` file implements a complete propositional logic system:

- **Symbol**: Represents atomic propositions
- **Not**: Logical negation
- **And**: Logical conjunction
- **Or**: Logical disjunction  
- **Implication**: Logical implication (if-then)
- **Biconditional**: Logical equivalence (if and only if)

### Model Checking Algorithm

The solver uses a recursive model checking algorithm that:
1. Enumerates all possible truth value assignments
2. Checks if the knowledge base is consistent
3. Determines which symbols must be true in all valid models

## üéì Educational Value

This project demonstrates:
- **Propositional Logic**: Core concepts of formal logic
- **Model Checking**: Automated theorem proving techniques
- **Recursive Algorithms**: Tree traversal and backtracking
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean separation of logical operators

## üîç How It Works

1. **Symbol Definition**: Each person's identity is represented as a logical symbol
2. **Constraint Encoding**: Statements are translated into logical formulas
3. **Model Checking**: The algorithm finds all valid truth assignments
4. **Solution Extraction**: Symbols that are true in all valid models are identified

## üß™ Adding New Puzzles

To add a new puzzle:

1. Define symbols for each person:
   ```python
   XKnight = Symbol("X is a Knight")
   XKnave = Symbol("X is a Knave")
   ```

2. Encode the constraints:
   ```python
   knowledge = And(
       Or(XKnight, XKnave),
       Not(And(XKnight, XKnave)),
       # Add implications based on statements
   )
   ```

3. Add to the puzzles list in `main()`
